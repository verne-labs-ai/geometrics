geometrics documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation for ``geometrics``! This is an unified internal library for Verne Labs.
This package contains utilities for 3D geometry processing, including:

- Camera projection and calibration
- Point cloud processing
- Pose estimation and tracking
- Interpolation and smoothing
- Rigid transformations
- Geometric types and utilities

And the list is growing!
